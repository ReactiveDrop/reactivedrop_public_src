	"MailFrom3"     "To: Iris Florenza"
	"MailDate3"		"Date: 01/19/41"
	"MailSubject3"	"Subject: Expeditions kick off"
	"MailBody3A"	"Dear love,"
	"MailBody3B"    "It took a while longer than predicted for us to finally jumpstart geological and botanical expeditions, but we’ve made it. And though there’s certainly no lack of rocks... I myself doubt this cold globe’s potential for verdancy. In any case, it was your husband’s duty to safely navigate the first outdoor party. At least the dozens or so weeks spent planning routes did not go to waste. Thank the gods."
	"MailBody3C"    "I catch myself turning gaze more and more to Dr. Moreau as he ventures above research floors. Having come this far to be on the scientific community’s brighter side, I wouldn’t take him for anything else than a man of conviction… Still, his mental state only seems to have deteriorated since his wife’s passing. I can only sympathize with his pain and hope for a swift recovery, for the sake of the colony, for our future. Yours, mine, and our child’s."
	"MailBody3D"    "Nam Humanum."

	"MailDate4"		"Date: 05/28/41"
	"MailSubject4"	"Subject: Routine setting in"
	"MailBody4A"	"Dear love,"
	"MailBody4B"    "Expeditions to the unexplored surfaces of the planet proceeding with haste would be the least to say. I’ve already completed more tours than I had imagined tackling in a year. It’s a stressful task with its fair share of responsibilities, but it’s not without upsides. Every once in a while, whenever our eggheads halt the march in jolt only for them to stumble upon the smallest pebble of suspicious shape, I like to gaze at our dark sky and imagine that, at this very moment, you are, too, looking up to the stars."
	"MailBody4C"    "I’m happy to report that my concerns about Dr. Moreau proved unfounded after all. He and Captain Carradine are working hand in hand, making efforts at stimulating the colony with the set goal for the near future to facilitate the commuting process, finally get us out of our outdoor prefabs and potentially bring about new settlers for a “more dynamic environment”, or so they say. Though I’m not sure how much longer exactly I’ve to yearn for your presence, I'm glad things seem to be shaping up again."
	"MailBody4D"    "Nam Humanum."
