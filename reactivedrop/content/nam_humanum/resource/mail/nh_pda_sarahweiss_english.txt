    // Sent mail

	"MailFrom3"		"To: Lt. Gael Florenza"
	"MailDate3"		"Date: 06/16/42"
	"MailSubject3"	"Subject: It’s Carradine"
	"MailBody3A"    "[Sending failed: Your PDA has been disconnected from the network]"
	"MailBody3B"	"Florenza, I’m choosing you to receive this ‘cause… Shit. Hate to admit that even though you're a nag, you’re really the less bad of us."
	"MailBody3C"    "I’d bet my badge on it: Captain Carradine has something to do with the disappearances. If he isn’t himself at the bottom of it, he’s definitely in bed with those who are. How do I know? ‘Cause I asked one question too many that he couldn’t answer for the life of him. A war hero, yeah, and one lying wh*reson too. Guess who shows up a couple days next, requesting me directly for a “maintenance assignment”, no questions asked. Maintenance my ass. Fucker locked me inside the old storage doors’ control room. Left me to rot like a rat in a cage. He even dared feign a power failure, but I’m no fool. Not a moment after, my PDA was disconnected from the server. Talk about a coincidence."
	"MailBody3D"    "Lieutenant, if I kick the bucket in here but by whatever miracle you receive this message: stop these bastards, ‘cause you’re the only one who can."
