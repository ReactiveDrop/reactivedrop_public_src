	"MailSubject3"	"Subject: A colony in mourning"
	"MailBody3A"	"Dear love,"
	"MailBody3B"    "Today’s a sad day for Lugdunum. Miss Moreau, Helen, passed away suddenly following complications caused by a malignant tumor. I won’t claim to have known her well, but she most definitely was a remarkable woman. Her warm, youthlike eagerness in making this colony hospitable was cherished by each and every member of our community. In our own way, I have no doubt each of us will be carrying this grief."
	"MailBody3C"    "I am deeply touched for Dr. Moreau. I wouldn’t dare imagine what would become of me if you or our sweet Isaac were to disappear. I think of you two every long night that passes by on this cold, distant planet."
	"MailBody3D"    "Nam Humanum."
