	"MailDate1"		"Date: 07/01/42"
	"MailSubject1"	"Subject: Fresh assignment"
	"MailBody1A"	"Riddle me this: what looks human but is actually a highly-advanced cyborg specifically programmed by SynTek to make all our lives miserable? If your answer was “that motherf*cker Carradine”, you win a pickle. No, not really. They went extinct decades ago anyway."
	"MailBody1B"	"Ah, but I’m sure you must be dying to hear what your new mission entails. It is of the utmost importance so pray, take heed... Captain wants to have the colonial adage slapped on every two walls of Lugdunum. Yep, that’s it. Weird cult shit, huh? Don’t complain, ‘cause chain of commands won’t budge on my account. At least you got your weekly schedule worked out for you. Careful of not covering any ventilation shafts tho, could lead to fires. Don’t ask me how either."
	"MailBody1C"	"'Nam Humanum'... Think that’s even legit Latin?"

	"MailBody3A"	"Never mind their lame-ass motto. As if it wasn’t humiliating enough stationing me here. I haven’t suffered through bioastronautics classes for me to paint walls."
	"MailBody3B"	"I’ll sit right here and stay the unproductive member of society that they think I am, thank you very much. What are they gonna do, sue me? We’re literally a dubious scientific expedition with no legal resort or court of law."
