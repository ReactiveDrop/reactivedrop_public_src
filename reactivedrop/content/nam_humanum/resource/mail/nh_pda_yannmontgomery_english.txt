	"MailBody1A"	"I thank you for your time, Professor. Your expertise confirms most of my assumptions. Be certain in passing that measures of confinement are being handled by the book. Before we are perfectly sure of what we are dealing with however, I will ask you to refrain from contacting Phalanx for now."
	"MailBody1B"	"You will be further notified by my laboratory if needed."
	"MailFrom1C"	"Nam Humanum."

	"MailDate3"		"Date: 05/08/42"
	"MailSubject3"	"Subject: Preliminary considerations"
	"MailBody3A"	"Dear colleague. I have proceeded to a primary observation of the specimen group confined in your laboratory, as your department so... politely commanded. Keep in mind these are but initial thoughts - though their conclusions could be somewhat alarming."
	"MailBody3B"	"At first glance, the specimen essentially appears to follow a pattern of rather simple conduct, which can be summarized as the search and removal of any potential threat to its survival - meaning us. More importantly, in my entire 27 years-long career, never have I seen behavioral evidences so strongly supporting the hive mind theory, be they of animals, plants or fungi. They move and rest as if they were family, or rather something along the line of a swarm - suggesting the existence of a higher intuition connecting each entity to every other. How is this connection established and to what extent, is the real question."
	"MailBody3C"	"You will find the complete manuscript of my observations attached to this mail, which I will also relay to Phalanx Station after revision. If I may append a personal request, I would love to learn of this specimen's basis and how exactly your team came to its discovery. It would be a great privilege to participate in its study as well. I remain at your disposal in this prospect of newfound partnership. Nam Humanum."
	"MailBody3D"	"PS: it should go without saying that necessary measures are to be adopted in averting an outbreak. Though I’m still skeptical about these creatures’ actual capacity for harm, the public agitation caused by the knowledge of their presence would obviously not be in Lugdunum’s best interest."

	"MailFrom4"     "To: Jonathan Dorland"
	"MailDate4"		"Date: 05/10/42"
	"MailSubject4"	"Subject: My apologies"
	"MailBody4A"	"Mister Dorland,"
	"MailBody4B"	"Although I share your concerns about Doctor Moreau’s more recent decisions, I, in all decency, cannot disclose anything to you following my visit inside his laboratories. Professional ethics preclude me from doing so, therefore I am afraid I will not meet you for lunch."
	"MailBody4C"	"In conjunction with my reserves, Captain Carradine has petitioned me in assisting the searches starting just this morning, thus it would have been impossible for me to join you anyhow."
	"MailBody4D"	"All the best to you."
