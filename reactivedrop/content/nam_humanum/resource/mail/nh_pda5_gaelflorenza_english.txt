	"MailFrom3"     "To: Iris Florenza"
	"MailDate3"		"Date: 06/25/42"
	"MailSubject3"	"Subject: Strange events"
	"MailBody3A"	"Dear love,"
	"MailBody3B"    "Strange things are happening in Lugdunum. I don't wish to make you worry, but translating my state of mind into letters has a somewhat therapeutic effect on me."
	"MailBody3C"    "I don’t know how, but settlers are simply vanishing. Sarah, the most recent among them, is a young sergeant recently assigned to my unit. One serious cavalier attitude to that one, but never so much as to vanish this way out of the blue… not mentioning the logistics quagmire it would induce in doing so. Cpt. Carradine says he takes the problem very seriously, but I’ve yet to hear him come up with a concrete plan. If someone is kidnapping people inside the colony, shouldn’t we be surveying the area and/or conducting residence searches? Dr. Moreau, for his part, seems solely focused on his research about the cave we found 6 months past. Only the scientific teams are still in contact with his laboratory, and even then his close staff seems to have been reduced by more than half. Today of all days, I do wish Miss Helen would still be with us. She would have known better than to keep her own people in the dark."
	"MailBody3D"    "Your loving husband."

	"MailFrom4"     "To: Iris Florenza"
	"MailDate4"		"Date: 11/14/42"
	"MailSubject4"	"Subject: Revelation"
	"MailBody4A"    "[Sending failed: Off-world communications restricted]"
	"MailBody4B"	"Iris, it pains me to even think of sharing this news with you. Since day one, Dr. Moreau has been the one arranging the disappearances. He gave up lying to me as soon as it became clear that these so-called “volunteers” kept being sent to his labs with clear backing from Cpt. Carradine."
	"MailBody4C"    "I don’t know what they’re doing with them. Some among the settlers are pressuring us custodians for the truth. I fear they can’t handle the truth... and perhaps neither can I. But since we’re the ones with guns, we get to decide whether or not they might show anything resembling a fight. Yesterday or the day before, a woman reached for my weapon in tears of anger... so I shot her. Every second since, I ask myself when or how we went about treating peers like mere cattle. I’ve had... strange dreams. About Helen Moreau. I can only hope that her husband is acting in favor of progress, for the wellbeing of all of us. An evil for a greater good, because I cannot accept it any other way."
	"MailBody4D"    "Your husband, loving no matter what."
