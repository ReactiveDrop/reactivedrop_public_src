	"MailSubject1"	"Subject: RE: Transfer of the scientific staff"
	"MailBody1A"	"Dr. Da Silva, my research demands of me that I maintain precision to near surgical degrees. And with that, quite befittingly in fact, proper focus. ‘Proper’ as in not being constantly interrupted with trivial concerns."
	"MailBody1B"	"While I do appreciate the tremendous aid provided thus far by your assistants, the ongoing operations - of which I am in charge by virtue of my attributions as Chief Scientist of this mission - could very well conclude in a shortened period of time if everyone finally agrees to leave me to my work."
	"MailBody1C"	"Thank you."

	"MailBody3A"	"Dr. Moreau,"
	"MailBody3B"	"At your request, I have shifted the biology team’s efforts to general research; the subjects from our most recent discovery have also been transferred to your personal laboratories. May I, however, ask you the reasoning behind such a decision?"
	"MailBody3C"	"Yours sincerely,"
	"MailBody3D"	"Dr. Lin Da Silva"

	"MailBody4A"	"Dr. Moreau,"
	"MailBody4B"	"Of course, I understand. To question your methods was not my intention. The additional subjects will be dispatched to you by the end of the week. Nam Humanum."
	"MailBody4C"	"Yours sincerely,"
