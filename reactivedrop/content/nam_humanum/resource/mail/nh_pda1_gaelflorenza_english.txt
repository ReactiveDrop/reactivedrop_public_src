    // Sent mail

	"MailFrom3"		"To: Iris Florenza"
	"MailDate3"		"Date: 01/18/40"
	"MailSubject3"	"Subject: Sound landing"
	"MailBody3A"	"Dear love,"
	"MailBody3B"	"The communications team asks that I keep any written transmissions brief while the installation is being worked on, so there you go. We finally landed on Cassius-III. As expected, the weather isn’t the gentlest out here. Not to mention that we’re still largely depending on the shuttle’s vitals. Still, everyone’s already doing their part to make it feel like home. Pictured like something worthy of a tale. But I guess my letters will have to do, from this snowy island of mine to where you are now, an ocean of stars away."
	"MailBody3C"	"It’s been 5 months since I've farewelled your harbor, dear Iris, but it already feels like an eternity at sea. I aim to make this modest colony a proper shelter for you and me, and for the little man growing inside of you."
	"MailBody3D"	"Nam Humanum."

	"MailFrom4"		"To: Iris Florenza"
	"MailDate4"		"Date: 02/07/40"
	"MailSubject4"	"Subject: A dream beginning"
	"MailBody4A"	"Dear love,"
	"MailBody4B"	"I’ve been informed that any message I’ll forward may travel for some time before it reaches you. The reason for it is... well, some technical gibberish I won’t get into. I hope all is well, for you and the baby. Construction out here is carrying on, the installation of the research complex standing as a monument to our progress. Geological expeditions won’t take place for another few months though, giving the right amount of time for the life support systems to read green."
	"MailBody4C"	"The mission’s chief scientists, Miss and Mister Moreau conduct the operations with enthusiasm, inspiration even. Settlers have already taken to calling them “Lugdunum’s Adam and Eve”. Seeing it put some much-needed smiles on their faces is somewhat reassuring, although I cannot explain why. What I’m certain of is that I’ll keep writing until we’re both here, together too. Who knows, maybe once we’ve made this place child-proof."
	"MailBody4D"	"Nam Humanum."
